&lt;p>Not foolproof. At about 2 hours the breast was overcooked (180-ish). It&amp;rsquo;s possible I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have preheated the pan. Could also just be the size of the chicken?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Salt baked chicken</title><link>https://ted.brandston.net/meal-planning/recipes/salt_baked_chicken/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ted.brandston.net/meal-planning/recipes/salt_baked_chicken/</guid><description>&lt;p>Notes: hard to figure out the right temperature on the stove at 6th Street. 4.5 or slightly higher resulted in the parchment burning after I turned the heat off, and the meat was slightly overcooked. This is with the temp probe cracking the lid a bit. Try Cooking at 4 w/ temp probe?&lt;br>
I wonder if there&amp;rsquo;s better ways to heat the salt, too. Afraid I could wreck a stainless steel pan, though. Maybe use cast iron?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
