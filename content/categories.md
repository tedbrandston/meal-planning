To help add structure and encourage us to eat a diversity of stuff, we've come up with some categories to try to rotate through:

* [Soup](../tags#soup)
* [Pasta](../tags#pasta)
* [Veggie main](../tags#veggie-main) (roughly twice a cycle)
* [Pizza](../tags#pizza)
* [Stew](../tags#stew) (roughly twice a cycle)
* [Kiddos choice](../tags#kiddos-choice)
* [Build-your-own](../tags#build-your-own)
* Bread and cheese night
* Dinner out (roughly twice a cycle)
