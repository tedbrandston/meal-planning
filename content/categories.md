title: "Categories"
---

To help add structure and encourage us to eat a diversity of stuff, we've come up with some categories to try to rotate through:

* [Soup](../tags#soup)
* [Pasta](../tags#pasta)
* [Veggie main](../tags#veggie-main) (roughly twice a cycle)
* [Pizza](../tags#pizza)
* [Stew](../tags#stew) (roughly twice a cycle)
* [Kiddos choice](../tags#kiddos-choice)
* [Build-your-own](../tags#build-your-own)
* Bread and cheese night
* Dinner out (roughly twice a cycle)

We also can break it down by seasonality, though we don't have a good way to select by dinner category âˆ© season.

* [Spring](../tags#spring)
* [Summer](../tags#summer)
* [Fall](../tags#fall)
* [Winter](../tags#winter)
