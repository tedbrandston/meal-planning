Notes: hard to figure out the right temperature on the stove at 6th Street. 4.5 or slightly higher resulted in the parchment burning after I turned the heat off, and the meat was slightly overcooked. This is with the temp probe cracking the lid a bit. Try Cooking at 4 w/ temp probe?   
I wonder if there's better ways to heat the salt, too. Afraid I could wreck a stainless steel pan, though. Maybe use cast iron?
