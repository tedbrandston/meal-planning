1 cup tahini  
2 cups roasted cashews (Kirkland)  
¼ cup sesame oil  
3 tbsp tamari  
1 tbsp Beijing rice vinegar  
2+ cloves garlic  
Blend  
¼ cup roasted sesame seeds  
Stir

½ cup of resulting mixture  
8oz cooked whole wheat noodles  
⅛ cup reserved pasta water  
Notes: cashew stuff tastes nice on its own, but on the noodles it's basically flavorless. Kids seem to like it
